# DFI_Manual
This python code needs opencv and numpy for manual evaluation of the DNA Fragmentation Index of a Sperm sample. 
Create a smear of sperm sample (or any other cell) and stain it with Acridine Orange protocol. Take 3 consecutive images (bright field, green and red fluorescent) and place them with a number at the end of the name that shows the sequence as bright field = 3*n, green = 3*n+1 and red = 3*n+2 in which n is the number of the field that you took images from. run the code and draw a rectangle around each cell and after being finished python prints all the numbers on the console.  The order is "Red Green redsignal greensignal DFI" on each line.
Watch video to learn how to use the code.
