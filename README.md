Create a smear of sperm sample (or any other cell) and stain it with Acridine Orange protocol. Take 3 consecutive images (bright field, green and red fluorescent) and place them with a number at the end of the name that shows the sequence as bright field = 3*n, green = 3*n+1 and red = 3*n+2 in which n is the number of the field that you took images from. run the code and draw a rectangle around each cell and after being finished python prints all the numbers on the console.  The order is "Red Green Red/(Red+Green))" on each line.
